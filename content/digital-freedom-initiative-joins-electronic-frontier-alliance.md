We are proud to announce that the Digital Freedom Initiative is joining the Electronic Frontier Alliance.

The Electronic Frontier Alliance is a network of local organizations affiliated with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
These organizations engage in a variety of work, ranging form the organization and running of hacker spaces and
community organizing, to developing and maintaining software and research projects.  The organizations within the
Alliance all agree to the following principles.


1. free expression: people should be able to speak their minds to whomever will listen.

2. security: technology should be trustworthy and answer to its users.

3. privacy: technology should allow private and anonymous speech, and allow users to set their own parameters about
what to share with whom.

4. creativity: technology should promote progress by allowing people to build on the ideas, creations, and inventions
of others.

5. access to knowledge: curiosity should be rewarded, not stifled.

We look forward to working with the EFF and the organizations within the Electronic Frontier Alliance as we attempt
to preserve and expand freedom, creativity and transparency in the digital world and beyond.
