Title: About DFI

Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.

It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. You've swallowed a planet! *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!

I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.
I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!

Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.
Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.
You hit me with a cricket bat.

Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

Did I mention we have comfy chairs? You hit me with a cricket bat. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!

Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!

The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. Did I mention we have comfy chairs?
